# Romeo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wrighteagle2d/wrighteaglebase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wrighteagle2d/wrighteaglebase)  

This is the code release of Romeo, which is developed from WrightEagleBASE, which serves as the basic framework of [WrightEagle](https://wrighteagle2d.github.io/). Credits goes to WrightEagleBase team.

# Highlights of WrightEagle team

- WrightEagle has won 6 **world champions** and 5 runners-up in annual RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D competitions since 2005. Detailed historical results from 2005 to 2013 can be found as follows:

- WrightEagle/WrightEagleBASE is developed following the [MAXQ-OP](https://github.com/aijunbai/taxi) online planning algorithm for [Markov Decision Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process). The [MAXQ-OP](https://github.com/aijunbai/taxi) task structure of the agent:

# Install
- ```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnurubuntu/rubuntu```
- ```sudo apt update```
- ```sudo apt install rcssserver rcssmonitor rcsslogplayer```
- ```git clone https://github.com/wrighteagle2d/wrighteaglebase```


# Compiling
- ```cd romeo```
- Run `make [debug]` for a debug version with debugging information and assertions
- Run `make release` for a release version


# Usages
A [RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/files/) (as well as a monitor and a logplayer) is needed to run Romeo. Please refer to (https://github.com/rcsoccersim/rcssserver) and (https://github.com/rcsoccersim/rcssmonitor) for installation instructions.  

After installation,  

- Run `rcssserver` to start a soccer server which simulates the game
- Run `rcssmonitor` to start a soccer monitor which is used to display the game
- Run `./start.sh` to start a team on the left side with default teamname *Romeo*
- Run `./start.sh -t [TEAMNAME]` to start a team on the right side with teamname *[TEAMNAME]* (This can varies between different teams)

After both teams are connected, send a `KickOff` command to the server by hitting `Ctrl+K` in the monitor to start the game!
